\section{Introduction}
Recently, the need to analyze and monitor atmospheric aerosols has grown significantly, as their negative impact has grown significantly in different sectors: human health, climatology and air transport. GRASP (Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties), which was introduced by Dubovik, is the first unified algorithm used for obtaining atmospheric properties from different remote sensing observations including satellite, ground-based and airborne measurements, both passive and active, of atmospheric radiation and their combinations\cite{grasp}.\smallskip\\
The main objective of this work is to develop a software that automates the full GRASP execution process, which includes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Download photometer data from the Aeronet web site
    \item Download Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) data from the ACTRIS-EARLINET web site
    \item Combine the data downloaded from both web sites
    \item Run GRASP
    \item Plot the obtained results
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Gantt Diagram}
The time organization of the project is shown in the Gantt diagram of \Cref{fig:gantt} representing a time lapse of one semester. It is important to note that even there are different groups of tasks for implementation and testing, tests have been executed during the implementation phase to ensure the correct functionality of the different steps.
