\section{Research and plan}
{This second step helps optimize both time and resources by preventing unnecessary work. Since this project builds upon a previous one, it is not required to develop new code for certain application requirements. Furthermore, the availability of APIs for downloading measurements from the ACTRIS–EARLINET Data Portal \cite{earlinet_web} and AERONET web application \cite{aeronet_web} provides a convenient and efficient solution that can significantly reduce development effort.}
