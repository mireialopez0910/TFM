\section{Methodology}

 {In order to create a new application , it is necessary to follow the following steps, to create a strong foundation.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item {Create a list of requirements}
    \item {Research and plan}
    \item {Design the architecture}
    \item {Design the graphical user interface (GUI)}
    \item {Set up development environment}
    \item {Implement}
    \item {Test}
    \item {Deployment}
    \item {Maintenance}
\end{itemize}


{For the development of the application, it has been decided to use an hybrid structure, using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with C\# and MATLAB scripting.\smallskip\\
The main advantages of using C\# with OOP are that it allows the code to be reusable, organized and easy to maintain \cite{profile_OOP}. In this project, it has been used for the development of the Graphical User Interface and the controllers for both, web services and MATLAB script management.\smallskip\\
In the other hand, MATLAB provides a specialized environment for numerical calculations, simulations, and complex data analysis\cite{matlab}. Working directly with matrixes and arrays makes the data processing and visualitzation easier and more efficient.}
