{In this tab, the user is available to choose the range of dates to download the files from the different websites. For the moment, it is only available to download files from Barcelona site, but it is planned in the near future to add the option to download files from other sites.\smallskip\\
During the process, all buttons will be disabled and the progress bar will show the percentage of files downloaded. Once all files are downloaded, a new section will be shown where the user will be able to see the list of files downloaded and select the files that desires to keep. This section will be also shown if the user opens a project with already downloaded files (\Cref{fig:ProjectOpenedDownload}). }
